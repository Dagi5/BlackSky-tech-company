## Inspiration 

Even though BlackSky is a fictional tech company it is has been always a dream of mine to have my own tech company and i figured why not create a webpage even if it is just for fun [for the time being at least].

## Design 

As im sure you can tell the design of the website was inspired by futuristic and minimalistic concepts.

## Features

varies animations have been implemented in this site and a feel of minimalism and simplistic ways of informing the viewer.
